Introduction to CSS
In the previous assignment, the student added some text to the web page. In this assignment the student should apply styling to the current stage of the personal web site. We suggest including the following CSS properties:  

Font-color, font-weight, font-family, font-size 
Text-align, text-decoration, text-shadow, text-transform 
background-color, color. 
It is important to use HTML boxes such as header, main, footer or/and div so you can group several elements and make the styling easier.
